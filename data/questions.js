		"question": "Is it possible for governments to track and photo me using satellites?",
		"answer": "Very unlikely, from current photographing technology, to produce a clear image of you, for instance 1 meter by 1 meter resolution, the satellite would be required to be put in “Low Earth Orbit (LEO)” (i.e. altitude less than 2000km). The International Space Station and the Iridium satellites, which supports satellite phone calls and internet are in the LEO. Objects in the Low Earth Orbit move fast relative to the ground (imagine a plane), so it will not have a direct line of sight to a specific point on the ground for more than a few hours. For example, most passes of the ISS are only visible to the specific point on the ground for less than 10 minutes.<br/>There are also spy satellites that are in Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). GEO satellites constantly stay above a patch of Earth, thus providing constant 24 hour surveillance of a geographic area. But due to high altitudes, the image resolution are less. The Chinese Gaofen 4 satellite have a image resolution of about 40 meters, and it only has range of view in a 7,000km by 7,000km box of 49 million square kilometers of Asian land and water in and around China.<br/>You should probably learn more about spy planes and drones, though, they are more technically viable option to surveil you.",

		"question": "Is it safer if I communicate sensitive message by sending image instead of text on messaging softwares such as Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, or WeChat?",
		"answer": "No, image recognition technologies have gotten really good in recent years, they can roughly identify types of items in the image and also recognize text in the image. It will only take very little extra processing time to do so. (compared to processing text messages)<br/>We suggest you to use secure messaging apps such as Signal to transmit sensitive information.",
